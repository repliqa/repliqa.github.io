Why do we need to liberate technology?
Technology is in a BAD state. Because of 2 primary issues: some issues are problems with masses while others are technical problems. We discuss both here:
1. Issues with Masses:

<p>Why do we need to liberate technology?
Technology is in a BAD state. Because of 2 primary issues: some issues are problems with masses while others are technical problems. We discuss both here:</p>
<h2 id="1-issues-with-masses">1. Issues with Masses:</h2>
<p>Have you ever felt like you are stuck in a content loop on social media platforms and you just can&rsquo;t get out of it? Or you can&rsquo;t stop binge watching videos on YouTube?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Getting ignorantly manipulated</strong>: Social Media platforms use specliazed techniques to make you stuck on their contents. I&rsquo;m not making this up. These are known facts and techniques very commonly used in today&rsquo;s world specially far more with Machine Learning and AI: <strong>They make intentionally it difficult for you to leave.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Telling people what to do and believe</strong>: Every piece of data we consume has some form of psychological effects on ourselves. Think of music. Think of Facebook posts and reddit wars. Everything you watch creates some form of emotion in you. Some make you happy, some make you distressed and based on them, you take some action. These emotions and feelings have effect on people. We are not suggesting lEt ThE elITeS dEcIDe WhAT pEoPLe ThInK and fEEl. But we are doing the opposite. Recommendation algorithms are used to figure out how you think and feel based on content you are provided. They are very smart and they carefully pick and provide you with content that will be irresistible to you. even you might feel like it&rsquo;s good for you. You might think? OH but I&rsquo;m watching documentaries and chemistry experiments on YouTube! Are you consuming the content as much as you need to or do you find yourself spending more time? Does the consumption of content benefit you? (You can watch for entertainment purposes, but after a certain time of consumption of those contents, it becomes addiction. Not entertainment and the <strong>bad effects will outweigh the benefits of the information you gain.</strong>) and we are telling you that, it is possible and you shouldn&rsquo;t let someone else decide what you should think and feel.</li>
<li><strong>Making decisions that HARM the growh of technology</strong>: Buying a product just because other people buy it, it looks cool: These products are often time VERY consumer-unfriendly. Companies do not care about providing you the best services in exchange for the money you provide. They will make things overpriced and still beg for more through subscriptions, and worst part is people will actually buy those products because <strong>it is the norm</strong> and <strong>everything else is doing it, so it is right</strong>. These behavior only make more companies screw people over.</li>
</ul>
<p>Common statements people make:
<strong>Q:</strong> PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND THINGS FOR THEMSELVES. YOU DONT HAVE TO SPEAK!
<strong>A:</strong> When we are making any claims, we are talking about the general public: the mediocre (We are not considering ourselves as a different group. We are as mediocre as anyone else. But just listen to what I have to say). Most people DO NOT care about the implications of signing TOSes that end up screwing them later (There are hundreds of example, Louiss Rossman reference). Most people DO NOT care that Apple is starting to provide less equipments for more money (No charger from the box). Most people DO NOT care about car company putting their suspension behind a monthly pay wall. Companies are turning to assholes and people do not care.
And</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: But of course, isn&rsquo;t it important for organizations like FBI, CIA and governments to carefully spy on people to watch out for terrorist organizations and possible criminals through bac
<strong>A</strong>: That is a moral problem that is more concerned with the moral state of a society and its beliefs and practices. Technology cannot be and shouldn&rsquo;t be reformed in any that can prevent that issue, because technology is not something owned by a single entity and because it would mean the end of privacy and freedom.</p>
<h2 id="2-technical-issues">2. Technical issues</h2>
<p>Technology has become huge, complex, owned by a select few and it is getting worse.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unstable</strong>: Software crash a lot, break a lot at present time. Some things simply stop working without ANY explanation. Have we ever noticed that? And it has become a norm to expect the software to crash. WHY?</li>
<li><strong>Complex</strong>: Contains lots of layers of abstractions. With every layer of abstraction we build, we now have MORE THINGS to CAREFULLY MAINTAIN. Are we doing that? Software projects, for example can vanish at any point in time and all the other projects that depend on them also vanish. Hardware companies for example, could just stop producing processors at some point in time. Producing them are complicated. They require deep knowledge that is contained within a fixed group. If they vanish, the knowledge also vanishes. And it is becoming easier to vanish because that knowledge is becoming more and more complex. How long can we stack weights on the shoulders of the giants before it falls? How many abstraction layers can we stack until people start to forget how to base-level tech works? (For example, new DevOps engineers would be so worried about Kubernetes, Docker that they might not ever learn how an OS works in depth.)</li>
<li><strong>Insecure (and becoming more insecure with time)</strong>: Consider hidden backdoors for example. Hidden code that could be used for malicious purposes to get access to your computers. And the detection of such code (that is intentionally/unintentionally produced) becomes more difficult with the amount of dependencies and code. Most present software have many moving pieces, this connected to that, that connected to that over there: microservices, APIs, etc. cluttered together which we call Modern Software. Which means there is more room for error. In 10000 line of code, it&rsquo;s easier to find a bug than in a program with 50000 lines of code, connected to another software, connected to another software. Some bug in one software can cause some other software to break. (Consider the xz-exploit) And also why are other simpler more-stable systems more unaffected by such problems?</li>
<li><strong>Owned by a select few</strong>: Intel, AMD, ARM - these are the known processors people commonly used around the world and these are (and the knowledge to produce them) OWNED by a few countries. Any other country, small one for example, DO NOT own or control how these technologies are distributed/sold/used. They are provided based on the policy of the company that may be changed because of circumstances. And the policies are slowly becoming more consumer-unfriendly. Which means more than half of the countries are depending on things that it doesn&rsquo;t control or own.</li>
<li><strong>Sailing towards the WRONG DIRECTION</strong>: People think FANCY is good: how do I put it, <strong>IT IS NOT</strong>. Corporations love to use complex technical terminologies because well everyone else is doing it and we need to compete for money! It&rsquo;s evident from this ideology present in corporations is that they are not thinking from a technical point of view, about what is right and what is wrong. The industries are currently specifying where technology should go to for the sake of the survivality and the growth of the corporations, not of the technology.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="solutions">Solutions</h1>
<p>I hope it&rsquo;s clear from these discussions that IT IS important from people to understand the the current state technology in in: These are things that the average consumer DO NOT THINK about. And that is the issue. Because it creates many problems as stated above. Once we have understood the current state of technology and the issues, we are going to specify the solutions:</p>
<p>Technology <strong>should</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be used by the user when he/she wishes to without being manipulated to use it</li>
<li>Be free and owned by all who chooses to use it (including Hardware)</li>
<li>Consumer friendly, easy to repair, reduces waste and good for environment</li>
</ul>
<p>Technology <strong>shouldn&rsquo;t</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell the user what to do and what to think</li>
<li>Because a complex mess and die</li>
<li>Be owned by a select few</li>
<li>Invade people&rsquo;s privacy</li>
</ul>
<p>To accomplish these, we need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Software and Hardware that is AVAILABLE</li>
<li>Software and Hardware that is FREE (In terms of Freedom)</li>
<li>Software and Hardware that is SIMPLE and SECURE</li>
<li>Software and Hardware that SURVIVE</li>
</ul>
<p>And we believe that IT IS possible to REFORM technology in such a way, at least in small communities in small scales, that mitigates these issues to a great extent.</p>
